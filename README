This is qteyes, an xeyes clone.

I wrote this piece of software to find my mouse pointer on the two or three
monitor screens connected to my computer.
Unfortunately xeyes did not work well with the Ubuntu 18.4 distribution, so
I started to write my own eyes app. Currently this piece of software is
doing its jobs with the genome desktop. But not with the KDE desktop. It
still needs some polishing. Which is sceduled to where I got some free time.

Feel free to contact me by github.com in case you need support or got
suggestions for an improovement - at best with some example code or code
patch.
